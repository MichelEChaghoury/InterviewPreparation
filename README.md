# Interview Preparation

## Technical Interview Questions

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of common and important data structures and algorithms that are frequently asked during technical interviews.

Each class represents a problem and includes comments and solutions to provide explanations. The problems are organized into packages, with each package further divided into three sub-packages based on the problem's difficulty level: Easy, Medium, and Hard.  
These sub-packages contain problems related to the same concepts and data structures.

The project is structured as follows:

### Main Package

- Array
- Pointer
- Window Slider
- Stack
- Binary Search
- Dynamic Programming

### Behavioral Interview Questions

The `FAQ.md` file includes a compilation of the most common and frequently asked questions along with their answers, specifically focusing on behavioral interviews.
