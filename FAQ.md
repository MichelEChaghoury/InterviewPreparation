# Questions asked during behavioral interviews

## Tell me about yourself

First of all, Thank you very much for allowing me to be interviewed for this position today, I would describe myself as a resourceful, energetic, and passionate employee who has the skills and qualities to match the job description, previous managers would often describe me as industrious, trustworthy, and someone they could rely on to carry out their duties on time and to an exacting standard. I am very ambitious and a High achiever so for example in my last role I helped my company achieve performance improvement of 20% by improving their code base and optimizing database queries. I keep myself fit and active outside of work which means my energy and concentration levels are always high, and if you hire me I will take personal responsibility for my ongoing development which means I will always be a highly productive member of your team

## How do you prioritize your work?

I always prioritize my work and daily tasks in line with my employer's goals and long-term objectives.  
For example, if my employer's main objective(s) is to close tickets related to bugs, and issues especially the ones with the nearest deadlines. I will prioritize these tasks and make sure to close them before reaching deadlines.  
To make sure my work is prioritized accordingly, I will use a color-coded system.  
**Red Tasks** are urgent and require my immediate attention; **amber Tasks** come second, and **Green Tasks** can be left until I have more time available.

## How do you ensure important deadlines are met?

I follow a 5-step process to ensure all deadlines are met.

1. I **evaluate** what is required, establish the end goal, and assess my workload.
1. I will decide on the **resources** and Time **needed** to meet the deadline before creating a time-focused Work Schedule.
1. I **consider** any potential **Problems or Challenges** I may encounter during my work and plan accordingly.
1. I will then **begin work** and **take action to limit all distractions**.
1. Finally, I will periodically **Assess my Progress against the work schedule** and **adapt my space or style of work until the deadline is met**.

## Tell me about a time you had to manage multiple tasks or projects

Use the **STAR** technique:

- Situation: In my previous Job, I volunteered to cover the tasks of a co-worker who was off sick for several weeks. This situation resulted in me having to manage the work of two people.
- Task: It was my task to ensure my own work, and that of my co-workers were completed on time and to the required standards.
- Action: I started by collating both my own and my co-worker's duties into a list. I then rearranged the list with the urgent tasks at the top, and the remainder in descending order based on priority, I then decided how long each task would take to complete including the resources needed. Finally, I blocked out my diary, canceled non-urgent appointments and set to work.
- Result: By being meticulous in my planning and organizing, I was able to complete the work of two people while my co-worker was off sick. My manager praised me for my work ethic and the fact I had volunteered during a very busy period for the company.

## How do you organize your workspace?

I Organize my workspace by doing four things.

1. Number one, anything I need to complete my work is left out on the workstation. For example, this would normally include my computer, work diary, second screen or device, and notepad.
2. Number two, anything that isn't needed is put away tidily in my drawer. This results in less clutter and the chance of something getting lost or misplaced.
3. Number three, anything that is pending, or requires my attention soon, is placed in a filling system on my desk.
4. Finally, number four, at the end of each working day, I will clean my workspace in preparation for the following day's work.
