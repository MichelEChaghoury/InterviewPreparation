## What didn't you like about your last job?

There wasn't much I disliked about my last job. However, if I did have to choose something, I would say it was the slight lack of ambition the company demonstrated at times. I could see lots of opportunities for us to take advantage of in the industry, such as new products and services that our customers wanted. However, whenever I put forward any ideas and suggestions, the company didn't want to take them forward or listen to what I had to say. While I respected their decision, I felt it was a missed opportunity.

## Tell me about a time you dealt with a difficult co-worker

In my previous job, I was tasked with working alongside a senior member of the team. Unfortunately, he was not very approachable, and whenever I put forward ideas and suggestions, he immediately dismissed them. I decided to try a different approach. I found out that we both supported the same sports team and during a work break, I started talking to him about the team and the upcoming games. He immediately changed his attitude toward me, and we discussed our common interests. From that day onwards, he was engaging, helpful, and cooperative whenever I wanted to discuss work-related matters we were both collaborating on.

## Tell me about a time you had to manage multiple tasks or projects

Use the **STAR** technique:

- Situation: In my previous Job, I volunteered to cover the tasks of a co-worker who was off sick for several weeks. This situation resulted in me having to manage the work of two people.
- Task: It was my task to ensure my work, and that of my co-workers were completed on time and to the required standards.
- Action: I started by collating both my own and my co-worker's duties into a list. I then rearranged the list with the urgent tasks at the top, and the remainder in descending order based on priority, I then decided how long each task would take to complete including the resources needed. Finally, I blocked out my diary, canceled non-urgent appointments, and set to work.
- Result: By being meticulous in my planning and organizing, I was able to complete the work of two people while my co-worker was off sick. My manager praised me for my work ethic and the fact I had volunteered during a very busy period for the company.

## How do you organize your workspace?

I Organize my workspace by doing four things.

1. Number one, anything I need to complete my work is left out on the workstation. For example, this would normally include my computer, work diary, second screen or device, and notepad.
2. Number two, anything that isn't needed is put away tidily in my drawer. This results in less clutter and the chance of something getting lost or misplaced.
3. Number three, anything that is pending, or requires my attention soon, is placed in a filling system on my desk.
4. Finally, number four, at the end of each working day, I will clean my workspace in preparation for the following day's work.

## How do you define success?

## It's late on Friday afternoon and nearly time to go home. The company's website crashes. What would you do?

The wrong thing to do in this situation would be to leave it until Monday because the company would lose sales and revenue over the weekend.  
Therefore, I would quickly assess the problem myself to see if the website issue was an obvious one.
